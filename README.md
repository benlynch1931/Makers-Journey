[Week 1](#week1) | [Week 2](#week2) | [Week 3](#week3) | [Week 4](#week4) | [Week 5](#week5) | [Week 6](#week5) | [Week 7](#week7) | [Week 8](#week8) | [Week 9](#week9) | [Week 10](#week10) | [Week 11](#week11) | [Week 12](#week12)

# <a name="week1">Week 1</a>

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn to program using TDD. **✓**
2. Debug programs using Makers' Mantra. **✓**
3. Pair using the driver-navigator style. **✓**
4. Describe some basic Object-Oriented principles **✓**

### Plans to achieve these goals:
1. Work through the Boris Bike Challenge and attend the morning workshops.
2. Debug two programs provided that contain multiple testing and syntax errors.
3. Work on pratical resources provided to strengthen knowledge, and write a blog to help others understand these principles.
4. Each afternoon, spend 3-4hours pair-programming with a different partners, following best practices and learning from them. Use Google Forms to get responses back from my partners. See here.

### Evidence:
1.
- Long and immersive step-wise Boris Bike challenge [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/boris_bikes) - ability to view progress through commits and see the development of the program through the various tests set up.
- Exercise from skills-workshop involving creating a diary program using TDD. See my progress [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/Secret-Diary-TDD)

2. Debugged a couple of programs - view here.
3. Completed repo for [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/benlynch1931/boris_bikes) challenge with list of Contributers in the README.md
4. Wrote a blog explaining Encapsulation, found [here](https://benlynch1931.wixsite.com/benthedevsblog).

### Response 1-1

&#x2714; "Explained some of the elements that were new to me."
- I am pleased to know that I am passing on knowledge that I have that others may not. It is also nice to hear that people are benefitting from this.

&#x2718; "Perhaps take a breath and try to use the errors. avoiding too much frustration"
- It is useful to hear this as I have always tried to rush through things.
- I shall use this advice and learn to calm and slow myself, ensuring I have all information I possibly can before I proceed. This will eventually lead to better practice, more efficient code and less errors.

### Response 2-2

&#x2714; "Great communication and sound advise, able to easily conceptualise tests/code and take things step by step. Thanks for all the tips and tricks!
- Glad to know that not only my knowledge is useful but the small tips I pick up along the way are put to good use. I thought I struggled with step-by-step at times, so happy to know I am building on better practice.

### Monday 5th October

- **Goal** : Explain the 4 main principles in OOP
- **Plan** : Write a blog that explains the 4 main ideas in a brief description. Including examples where possible.
- **Evidence** : Blog available [here](https://benlynch1931.wixsite.com/benthedevsblog), on my blog website.


### Tuesday 6th October

- **Goal** : Use Class Diagrams and split 1 class into multiple classes and maintain coverage.
- **Plan** : Used the information from diagramming workshop and TDD the exercise in 1 class, then create class diagram to implement multiple classes. If coverage is low, imput more tests to fix this
- **Evidence** : Shown [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/notebook), through commits.


### Wednesday 7th October

- **Goal** : Learn how to use mocking to test isolated classes. Learn how doubles work.
- **Plan** : Use the practical example that applies the idea to SecretDiary.
- **Evidence** : Found [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/testing_relationships_between_classes) and [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/notebook) on my github. The commits show progression of updating tests to include true instances and include testing behaviour NOT state. This was possible with the help of Tatsiana and her advice!


### Thursday 8th October

- **Goal** : Learn how to apply *Dependency Injection* to programs
- **Plan** : Use the practical resource as an example, then find existing programs and apply to them.
- **Evidence** : Can be seen [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/notebook) and [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/Secret-Diary-TDD). From now on, I shall ensure most if not all my programs are applying Dependency Injection.

### Response 1-3

&#x2714; "Confident in his process of thinking, knew how to express his opinions effectively and was a good communicator."
- It seems the building of thinking/step-by-step process is beginning to take shape.
- It is a great thing to hear that I am communicating well as this is an essential soft-skill to have

&#x2718; "Unable to comment"
- It's nice to know people struggle to find improvements as this mean I am not getting hindered too often and that I am progressing really well.

### Response 2-4

&#x2714; "Setup(ready to work, organized desktop), Good communication, looking ahead"
- I will admit I take pride in my setup and how I lay out my windows.
- I am not surprised that I was thinking ahead, it is a useful tool, but I will have to learn to switch it off at times.

&#x2718; "N/A"
- Another 'loss of words' almost. I shall start to self-reflect if I have time as an addition to the forms I send out.

## <a name="process">Process Workshop Feedback</a>

### Response 1:

&#x2714; "Clear and efficient setup. Laid out screen so you can see everything"
- I do take pride in how I lay out my windows as it helps increase my efficiency if I can see everything open!

&#x2714; "Read and checked the failing test even though you knew it would fail"
- It took me a lot of brain power to force myself to check all errors to get into a good practice/routine. I'm happy that this is noticed as a good thing.

&#x2714; "I liked that you were saying your thinking process. I could 'see' what you were writing without looking at your screen"
- I find it not only is useful for the observer, but also useful for me. It gives me a chance to let my brain fully process things without gettting ahead of myself. More often than not, I notcied a flaw in my idea as I'm speaking it, just from where my brain can process it fully.

&#x2718; "On occasion, you chanced the test according to the code. You should probably let it fail first"
- I hear you. I shall learn to let the test fail and then go and alter it where I need to.

### Tuesday 20th October

#### Weekly Goal:
- I used this morning to set up all necessary files and directories to create an app that interacts with a database. 
- Also, I allow titles and bodies to be entered, then for all of it to be inserted into a database table. This was a new conecpt for me as I hadn't executed an insert query in ruby yet, so I had fun playing around with it and debugging the errors I had.


### Wednesday 21st October

- **Goal** : Understand Domain/Diagram Models for Databases
- **Plan** : Use the workshop to understand what goes on, and apply myself to the practical
- **Evidence** : The result of the practical can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fQARnASjmnGDtWgPEBRwsdStJ17BASBIe0Rnn6z0fzY/edit#gid=0) and my personal CRC [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s9YzaNu68xy8Qng9Ib4xvvGeDiNB1qjjsBtLiK5kLvA/edit#gid=0).  I worked through the practical with two peers from my Cohort, so many thanks to them for the discussions and help!


### Friday 

- **Goal** : 
- **Plan** : Use '' practical resource supplied by Makers.
- **Evidence** : [here]() is the repo link to my work on this practical. It was useful to implement SQL into Ruby to understand how they interact and can work with each other.
