### Response 1

&#x2714; "Explained some of the elements that were new to me."
- I am pleased to know that I am passing on knowledge that I have that others may not. It is also nice to hear that people are benefitting from this.

&#x2718; "Perhaps take a breath and try to use the errors. avoiding too much frustration"
- It is useful to hear this as I have always tried to rush through things.
- I shall use this advice and learn to calm and slow myself, ensuring I have all information I possibly can before I proceed. This will eventually lead to better practice, more efficient code and less errors.

### Response 2

&#x2714; "Great communication and sound advise, able to easily conceptualise tests/code and take things step by step. Thanks for all the tips and tricks!
- Glad to know that not only my knowledge is useful but the small tips I pick up along the way are put to good use. I thought I struggled with step-by-step at times, so happy to know I am building on better practice.

&#x2718; N/A

2. Points 2 and 3 were completed together, so are on the same [repo](https://github.com/benlynch1931/Secret-Diary-TDD).
3. As Above.
4. The blog is available [here](https://benlynch1931.wixsite.com/benthedevsblog/post/object-oriented-principles-the-fundamental-four)

## <a name="daily-2">Daily Goals</a>

### Monday 5th October

- **Goal** : Explain the 4 main principles in OOP
- **Plan** : Write a blog that explains the 4 main ideas in a brief description. Including examples where possible.
- **Evidence** : Blog available [here](https://benlynch1931.wixsite.com/benthedevsblog), on my blog website.


### Tuesday 6th October

- **Goal** : Use Class Diagrams and split 1 class into multiple classes and maintain coverage.
- **Plan** : Used the information from diagramming workshop and TDD the exercise in 1 class, then create class diagram to implement multiple classes. If coverage is low, imput more tests to fix this
- **Evidence** : Shown [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/notebook), through commits.


### Wednesday 7th October

- **Goal** : Learn how to use mocking to test isolated classes. Learn how doubles work.
- **Plan** : Use the practical example that applies the idea to SecretDiary.
- **Evidence** : Found [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/testing_relationships_between_classes) and [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/notebook) on my github. The commits show progression of updating tests to include true instances and include testing behaviour NOT state. This was possible with the help of Tatsiana and her advice!


### Thursday 8th October

- **Goal** : Learn how to apply *Dependency Injection* to programs
- **Plan** : Use the practical resource as an example, then find existing programs and apply to them.
- **Evidence** : Can be seen [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/notebook) and [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/Secret-Diary-TDD). From now on, I shall ensure most if not all my programs are applying Dependency Injection.

### Response 1

&#x2714; "Confident in his process of thinking, knew how to express his opinions effectively and was a good communicator."
- It seems the building of thinking/step-by-step process is beginning to take shape.
- It is a great thing to hear that I am communicating well as this is an essential soft-skill to have

&#x2718; "Unable to comment"
- It's nice to know people struggle to find improvements as this mean I am not getting hindered too often and that I am progressing really well.

### Response 2

&#x2714; "Setup(ready to work, organized desktop), Good communication, looking ahead"
- I will admit I take pride in my setup and how I lay out my windows.
- I am not surprised that I was thinking ahead, it is a useful tool, but I will have to learn to switch it off at times.

&#x2718; "N/A"
- Another 'loss of words' almost. I shall start to self-reflect if I have time as an addition to the forms I send out.

## <a name="process-2">Process Workshop Feedback</a>

### Response 1:

&#x2714; "Clear and efficient setup. Laid out screen so you can see everything"
- I do take pride in how I lay out my windows as it helps increase my efficiency if I can see everything open!

&#x2714; "Read and checked the failing test even though you knew it would fail"
- It took me a lot of brain power to force myself to check all errors to get into a good practice/routine. I'm happy that this is noticed as a good thing.

&#x2714; "I liked that you were saying your thinking process. I could 'see' what you were writing without looking at your screen"
- I find it not only is useful for the observer, but also useful for me. It gives me a chance to let my brain fully process things without gettting ahead of myself. More often than not, I notcied a flaw in my idea as I'm speaking it, just from where my brain can process it fully.

&#x2718; "On occasion, you chanced the test according to the code. You should probably let it fail first"
- I hear you. I shall learn to let the test fail and then go and alter it where I need to.

### Response 1

&#x2714; "I felt that I was the 19 year old being guided and taught by a 34 professional as I was blown away by your knowledge and enthusiasm. Not only this, but your choice of wording when it comes to explaining concepts and programmes is of good quality, but you also demonstrated good use of falling back on examples when required. Keep this up and you will be driving Lamborghinis before you're 30!!!"
- This actually made me slightly emotional. I love positive feedback, it really helps me feel good about myself and what I'm doing. To hear this really boosts my confidence and gives me the motivation and drive to continue on!

### Response 2
&#x2714; "Really really knowledgable, very helpful and explanatory"
- It's great to know I'm knowledgable, but this doesn't compare to knowing that I am using the knowledge for good by helping others!

&#x2718; "For me, I could go slightly slower"
- I am sorry for going too fast, it isn't useful for whoever I'm with so I shall make sure I 'sit back' more and work at a pace better suited to my partner. Looking forward to pairing again and hoping I have worked on this issue

### Evidence:
1. See [Friday 23rd October](#fri-23)

## <a name="daily-4">Daily Goals</a>


### Tuesday 20th October

#### Weekly Goal:
- I used this morning to set up all necessary files and directories to create an app that interacts with a database.
- Also, I allow titles and bodies to be entered, then for all of it to be inserted into a database table. This was a new conecpt for me as I hadn't executed an insert query in ruby yet, so I had fun playing around with it and debugging the errors I had.


### Wednesday 21st October

- **Goal** : Understand Domain/Diagram Models for Databases
- **Plan** : Use the workshop to understand what goes on, and apply myself to the practical
- **Evidence** : The result of the practical can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fQARnASjmnGDtWgPEBRwsdStJ17BASBIe0Rnn6z0fzY/edit#gid=0) and my personal CRC [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s9YzaNu68xy8Qng9Ib4xvvGeDiNB1qjjsBtLiK5kLvA/edit#gid=0).  I worked through the practical with two peers from my Cohort, so many thanks to them for the discussions and help!


### <a name="fri-23">Friday 23rd October</a>

- **Goal** : Finish a diary web app as best as possible at the current moment
- **Plan** : Use practical resource supplied by Makers.
- **Evidence** : [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/Diary-Web-App) is the repo link to my work on this practical. It was useful to implement SQL into Ruby to understand how they interact and can work with each other.

## <a name="weekly-5">Weekly Goals</a>
Week 5 turned out to be Week 6 instead.
Week 5 consisted of building a clone of AirBNB in a team of 4-5 people. It was a great challenge and an even better insight into projects and group work you may get up to in the future.

I particularly enjoyed the freedom we were given to complete this challenge. I learned a lot of useful skills from my team and hope I will take on the feedback they gave me.

## <a name="daily-6">Daily Goals</a>

### Monday 2nd November

- **Goal** : TDD a simple FizzBuzz-JazzBuzz game.
- **Plan** : Use a guided walkthrough provided as a helper for learning JavaScript
- **Evidence** : Found on my profile [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/JazzBuzz-JS). I really enjoyed this as I was able to apply the syntax I was learning. I'm glad it was a really simple game as I couldn't handle the new syntax otherwise!


### Tuesday 3rd November

- **Goal** : Learn how to effectively debug a javascript/web app
- **Plan** : Attend the workshop and get involved with the practical and apply the knowledge else where
- **Evidence** : A hard one to find evidence for as it's done in the moment, but I'd have a good enough understanding to explain it to someone else/ talk through as I do it.


### Wednesday 4th November

- **Goal** : Translate Airport Challenge from Ruby to JavaScript
- **Plan** : Use knowledge pills and my Ruby code to translate into Javascript. I didn't re-do the logic, I just translated.
- **Evidence** : Found at this [link](https://github.com/benlynch1931/Thermostat). There is a link to my airport challenge in [ruby](https://github.com/benlynch1931/airport_challenge).


### Thursday 5th November

- **Goal** : Learn about Callbacks, the Event Loop, ASync and the flow-control.
- **Plan** : Use the skills workshop on ASync and callbacks and a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) by Philip Roberts
- **Evidence** : Found here in the skills workshop [async_JS.md](https://github.com/benlynch1931/skills-workshops/blob/master/week-5/async_JS.md). I added my expectation and the result for each example and have brief definitions at the foot.


### Friday 6th November

- **Goal** : Read into Closures.
- **Plan** : Complete the practical provided on the AirTable. Had a useful Zoom call with a coach to ask questions about closures and closures Vs. classes.
- **Evidence** : Created a Markdown [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dtgaP-c_NuTNRoL-mdGLolFLXgsJExmT/view?usp=sharing) containing the example, my prediction, the true result and a brief explanation of what happened and why.

### Response 1-

&#x2714; 'Taking time to explain things he had a better grasp of'
- I always feel bad if I know something in better than detail to my peers, so I always try to explain it so they also understand as we are all in the same boat. I hope I continue to keep this up!

&#x2718; 'We both should have initiated a couple of breaks'
- I always find it useful to hear this, I definitely need to be getting away from the screen more regularly. I shall ensure that any future sessions involve me taking more breaks no matter what/


### Response 2-

&#x2714; "I found Ben to be enthusiastic and knowledgable. He made it clear when he disagreed with an idea put forward by me, however he remained open minded and tackled such occurances with a problem solving attitude which I found both helpful and respectful.
He was clear about his thinking and his actions which allowed pairing to be a collaborative experience."
- Hearing that I present an attitude that is helpful and respectful is some really useful feedback as I believe this is a vital tool and skill for the future and working in teams.
- I apologise for disagreeing with ideas and hope we came to a compromise together and that we discussed all options and how we could tweak the ideas to fit better!

&#x2718; "There is nothing that comes to mine. Overall an enjoyable experience"
- I know this doesn't seem like a conventional improvement, but I can see how I can 'improve' by continuing to apply all positive feedback until it becomes even more natural to me.
