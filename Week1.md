# Week 1

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn to program using TDD. 
2. Debug programs using Makers' Mantra.
3. Pair using the driver-navigator style. **âœ“**
4. Describe some basic Object-Oriented principles

### Plans to achieve these goals:
1. Work through the Boris Bike Challenge and attend the morning workshops.
2. Debug two programs provided that contain multiple testing and syntax errors.
3. Work on pratical resources provided to strengthen knowledge, and write a blog to help others understand these principles.
4. Each afternoon, spend 3-4hours pair-programming with a different partners, following best practices and learning from them. Use Google Forms to get responses back from my partners. See here.

### Evidence:
1. 
- Long and immersive step-wise Boris Bike challenge here - ability to view progress through commits and see the development of the program through the various tests set up.

2. Debugged a couple of programs - view here.
3. Completed repo for Boris Mikes challenge with list of Contributers in the README.md
4. N/A
