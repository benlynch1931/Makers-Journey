## <a name="daily">Daily Goals</a>

### Monday 5th October

- **Goal** : Explain the 4 main principles in OOP
- **Plan** : Write a blog that explains the 4 main ideas in a brief description. Including examples where possible.
- **Evidence** : Blog available [here](https://benlynch1931.wixsite.com/benthedevsblog), on my blog website.


### Tuesday 6th October

- **Goal** : Use Class Diagrams and split 1 class into multiple classes and maintain coverage.
- **Plan** : Used the information from diagramming workshop and TDD the exercise in 1 class, then create class diagram to implement multiple classes. If coverage is low, imput more tests to fix this
- **Evidence** : Shown [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/notebook), through commits.


### Wednesday 7th October

- **Goal** : Learn how to use mocking to test isolated classes. Learn how doubles work.
- **Plan** : 
- **Evidence** :

### Response 1-3

&#x2714; "Confident in his process of thinking, knew how to express his opinions effectively and was a good communicator."
- It seems the building of thinking/step-by-step process is beginning to take shape.
- It is a great thing to hear that I am communicating well as this is an essential soft-skill to have

&#x2718; "Unable to comment"
- It's nice to know people struggle to find improvements as this mean I am not getting hindered too often and that I am progressing really well.

### Response 2-4

&#x2714; "Setup(ready to work, organized desktop), Good communication, looking ahead"
- I will admit I take pride in my setup and how I lay out my windows.
- I am not surprised that I was thinking ahead, it is a useful tool, but I will have to learn to switch it off at times.

&#x2718; "N/A"
- Another 'loss of words' almost. I shall start to self-reflect if I have time as an addition to the forms I send out.

## <a name="process">Process Workshop Feedback</a>

### Response 1:

&#x2714; "Clear and efficient setup. Laid out screen so you can see everything"
- I do take pride in how I lay out my windows as it helps increase my efficiency if I can see everything open!

&#x2714; "Read and checked the failing test even though you knew it would fail"
- It took me a lot of brain power to force myself to check all errors to get into a good practice/routine. I'm happy that this is noticed as a good thing.

&#x2714; "I liked that you were saying your thinking process. I could 'see' what you were writing without looking at your screen"
- I find it not only is useful for the observer, but also useful for me. It gives me a chance to let my brain fully process things without gettting ahead of myself. More often than not, I notcied a flaw in my idea as I'm speaking it, just from where my brain can process it fully.

&#x2718; "On occasion, you chanced the test according to the code. You should probably let it fail first"
- I hear you. I shall learn to let the test fail and then go and alter it where I need to.
