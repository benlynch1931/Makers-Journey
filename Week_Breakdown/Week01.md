# Week 1

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn to program using TDD. **✓**
2. Debug programs using Makers' Mantra. **✓**
3. Pair using the driver-navigator style. **✓**
4. Describe some basic Object-Oriented principles **✓**

### Plans to achieve these goals:
1. Work through the Boris Bike Challenge and attend the morning workshops.
2. Debug two programs provided that contain multiple testing and syntax errors.
3. Work on pratical resources provided to strengthen knowledge, and write a blog to help others understand these principles.
4. Each afternoon, spend 3-4hours pair-programming with a different partners, following best practices and learning from them. Use Google Forms to get responses back from my partners. See here.

### Evidence:
1. 
- Long and immersive step-wise Boris Bike challenge [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/boris_bikes) - ability to view progress through commits and see the development of the program through the various tests set up.
- Exercise from skills-workshop involving creating a diary program using TDD. See my progress [here](https://github.com/benlynch1931/Secret-Diary-TDD)

2. Debugged a couple of programs - view here.
3. Completed repo for [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/benlynch1931/boris_bikes) challenge with list of Contributers in the README.md
4. Wrote a blog explaining Encapsulation, found [here](https://benlynch1931.wixsite.com/benthedevsblog).

## Daily Goals

### Wednesday 30th September

- **Goal** : Fix the Geocoder Bug issue **✓**
- **Plan** : Compare the two Gems to find the syntax errors and added/missing lines
- **Evidence** : Check with a Coach to see if I was correct with my debugging. Error found in<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./really-broken-geocoder-2.0.0/lib/geocoder/query.rb:41 . There was a ```return``` that didn't belong.

### Thursday 1st October

- **Goal** : increase practical knowledge of TDD **✓**
- **Plan** : TDD a program using unit testing
- **Evidence** : [Secret-Diary](https://github.com/benlynch1931/Secret-Diary-TDD) program with commits showing progression of tests and the program


### Friday 2nd October

- **Goal** : Fully understand 'Encapsulation' on a theoretical and practical level
- **Plan** : Write a blog designed to simplify the definition, and that includes coded examples. 
- **Plan** : Work through the Secret-Diary exercise on encapsulation and cohesion.
- **Evidence** : N/A


## Pair-Programming Feedback

**Disclaimer!** *These are all anonynous due to my preferences. I didn't want anyone to feel awkward filling out the form.*

### Response 1-1

&#x2714; "Explained some of the elements that were new to me."
- I am pleased to know that I am passing on knowledge that I have that others may not. It is also nice to hear that people are benefitting from this.

&#x2718; "Perhaps take a breath and try to use the errors. avoiding too much frustration"
- It is useful to hear this as I have always tried to rush through things. 
- I shall use this advice and learn to calm and slow myself, ensuring I have all information I possibly can before I proceed. This will eventually lead to better practice, more efficient code and less errors.

### Response 2-2

&#x2714; "Great communication and sound advise, able to easily conceptualise tests/code and take things step by step. Thanks for all the tips and tricks!
- Glad to know that not only my knowledge is useful but the small tips I pick up along the way are put to good use. I thought I struggled with step-by-step at times, so happy to know I am building on better practice.
